  <section class="about">
    <!----"p1" can be changed into anything you like, you can even say "paragraph1"---->
    <p>A friend of mine loves red velvet cookies and decided to draw a picture of her standing on a stack of red velvet
      cookies.
      <!----break separates sentences from each other---->
      <br> Being inspired by this image, I wondered how does one actually make red velvet cookies.

  <section class="ingredients">
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 and 1/2 cups + 1 Tablespoon (196g) all-purpose flour (spoon & leveled</li>
      <li>1/4 cup (21g) unsweetened natural cocoa powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1/2 cup (115g) unsalted butter, softened to room temperature</li>
      <li>3/4 cup (150g) packed light or dark brown sugar</li>
      <li>1/4 cup (50g) granulated sugar</li>
      <li>1 large egg, at room temperature*</li>
      <li>1 Tablespoon milk (I use buttermilk)</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon gel red food coloring (or alternative)*</li>
      <li>1 cup (180g) semi-sweet chocolate chips (plus a few extra for after baking </li>

    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="steps">
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <!---"ol" creates a numbered list vs the "ul" that creates just a bulleted list--->
    <ol>
      <li>Whisk the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt together in a large bowl. Set aside.</li>
      <li>Using a handheld or stand mixer with a paddle attachment, beat the butter on high speed until creamy, about 1
        minute.</li>
      <li>Scrape down the sides and the bottom of the bowl as needed. </li>
      <li>Beat in the brown sugar and granulated sugar until combined and creamy, about 1 minute. </li>
      <li>Beat in the egg, milk, and vanilla extract, scraping down the sides and bottom of the bowl as needed. </li>
      <li>Once mixed, add the food coloring and beat until combined.</li>
      <li>Turn the mixer off and pour the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients. </li>
      <li>Turn the mixer on low and slowly beat until a very soft dough is formed. Beat in more food coloring if you’d
        like the dough to be brighter red. On low speed, beat in the chocolate chips. The dough will be sticky.</li>
      <li>Cover and chill the dough in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours (and up to 3 days). If chilling for longer
        than a few hours, allow the dough to sit at room temperature for at least 15 minutes before rolling and baking
        because the dough will be quite hard.</li>
      <li>Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Line two large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Set
        aside.</li>
      <li>Scoop 1.5 Tablespoons of dough and roll into a ball.</li>
      <li>Place 9 balls onto each baking sheet.</li>
      <li>Bake each batch for 13 minutes. The cookies may have only spread slightly, but that’s ok.</li>
      <li>Simply press down on the warm cookies to slightly flatten, which helps form crinkles. If desired for looks,
        stick a few chocolate chips into the tops of the warm cookies.</li>
      <li>Cool cookies on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
    </ol>
